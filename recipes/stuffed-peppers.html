    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <p>
          Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175
          degrees C).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        <p>
          Bring water and rice to a boil in a covered saucepan. Reduce heat to
          low and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and
          cook until evenly browned and crumbly, 7 to 9 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        <p>
          Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds,
          and membranes. Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make
          sure they stand up straight.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>
        <p>
          Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing
          upward.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 6</strong>
        <p>
          Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato
          sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and
          pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed pepper.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 7</strong>
        <p>
          Mix remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour
          over the stuffed peppers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 8</strong>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until
          peppers are tender, about 1 hour.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 9</strong>
        <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
